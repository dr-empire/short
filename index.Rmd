I'm a researcher and academic with a passion for understanding the complex relationships between media, society, and gender. When I'm not analyzing data or exploring the latest social media trends, you can find me investigating the intersection of media use, identity, and well-being. My research focuses on the political communication, social media, and science communication. In my current work, I'm interested in the role of sexism and gendered communication norms in shaping online discourses and political participation online. I use experimental, quantitative, and qualitative methods to understand society and I am committed to making my research open and accessible. I value critical thinking and strive to create a research environment that encourages students and colleagues to think critically about the media and its impact on society.
